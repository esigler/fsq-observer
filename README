fsq-observer - A few scripts to monitor the Foursquare API & associated web URLs
---
Notes:

Right, so this is pretty much a total kludge, and one I hope Foursquare will make obsolete soon.
(I threw this together in an evening while hunting down an API request issue.)

Basically it polls a few bits of the API and makes sure the responses are valid, and then queries
Stashboard to figure out if the state needs to be flipped around.

I'm _not_ running the tests on Google App Engine at the moment, though there's nothing that
prevents this from being factored quickly into a RequestHandler and added to cron.yaml.
---
Setup:

1) Go get Stashboard (http://www.stashboard.org/) and install it on Google App Engine
2) Configure Stashboard and add in all of the services that fsq-observer will update:

api-v1-test-endpoint
api-v1-create-checkin
api-v1-get-history
oauth-get-request-token
oauth-get-access-token
web-foursquare-homepage
web-oauth-authorization-page

3) Download runner.py, and configure any needed library dependencies
4) Gather all of the appropriate credentials from Foursquare & stashboard and add them to runner.py
5) Configure your timed-job facility of choice to run runner.py (I just used cron on a slicehost VM)

NOTE: Don't set the poll interval too low (I've started at 15 minutes), remember each poll creates
a checkin (so polling every minute would mean 1440 checkins/day), which may not be well received
by Foursquare.  :)

Useful things that could be done if I had the time:

- Coverage of more of the API
  - Including better options coverage / things like Oauth 1.1
- Still a bit more code duplication than I'd prefer
  - Could consider refactoring into an actual test framework, not sure if that makes sense
